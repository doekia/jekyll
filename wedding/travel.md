How to get here and get around, where to stay, and what to do.

### <i class="fa fa-plane" />&nbsp;AIRPORTS

Fly into O'Hare (ORD) or Midway (MDW), whichever is cheaper or easier.

### <i class="fa fa-car" />&nbsp;RENTAL CARS

Don't do it! You don't need it, don't want it. From O'Hare, you can get hotel shuttles, taxis, or take the "CTA Trains to City", which is a Blue Line El train. From Midway, take the Orange Line CTA train. Whereever you're coming from, you'll want to get off at the Clark and Lake station. From there, easy to get a taxi, or it's a short and safe walk to Michigan and Wacker if that's where you're staying.

### <i class="fa fa-train" />&nbsp;CTA EL TRAINS

To get around via El trains, the [CTA website](http://www.transitchicago.com/mobile/traintracker.aspx) is mobile friendly, or you can install the [Transit app](http://thetransitapp.com/). Unfortunately there's no train close to the venue, but cabs are everywhere downtown, as is Uber.

### <i class="fa fa-hotel" />&nbsp;HOTELS (sorted by distance)

We'll be staying at Hotel Lincoln, which is across the street from the venue, in order to get ready on the big day. If you want to overpay for a room, you're welcome to do the same! Otherwise, we'd suggest the next two, at Michigan and Wacker.

* [Hotel Lincoln](http://bit.ly/1xaTOnc), $350/night, across the street from venue, in [Lincoln Park](http://www.timeout.com/chicago/lincoln-park).

* [Club Quarters](http://bit.ly/1xaUn0f), $160/night special right now. Located at Michigan &amp; Wacker in [Streeterville](http://www.thechicagoneighborhoods.com/Streeterville), next to Magnificent Mile and River North neighborhoods. Interesting places to walk around, shop, eat, explore. Right on the Chicago river!

* [River Hotel](http://bit.ly/1xaUucg), $160/night special right now. Same location as Club Quarters.

* [Holiday Inn, Niles](http://bit.ly/1xaRJrr)
$150/night by I-94.  Upside: free parking. Downside: not really "Chicago", and the only transportation option to the venue is to drive, which you really don't want to do. This may be a good option for people driving from nearby states.

* [Hilton at O'Hare Airport](http://bit.ly/1xaTy7B)
Only $110, but an hour from the venue and city, and nothing nearby to do or eat. If you're planning to come all the way to Chicago and see nothing but the venue (sad face!), this is your hotel.

* [Heart of Chicago](http://bit.ly/1xaRnAU)
$105/night. This is a bare-bones 60's-era hotel, but clean, and at the north end of laid back
[Andersonville](http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/January-2013/A-Guide-to-Andersonville-Where-to-Eat-Shop-and-Play/) neighborhood.
Lots of good restaurants and family owned businesses. Nearly door-to-door access to venue via CTA bus, which takes about 45min. (Clark 22 bus @ http://bit.ly/1xaSmkR ). If you're feeling adventurous, most of the reviews seem to be positive.

### <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up" />&nbsp;THINGS TO DO

We're hoping those that ! Chicago is a great place to be in the summertime. Check out a [bicycle](https://www.divvybikes.com/) from stations all over the city, explore the 18mi bike path on Lake Michigan, camp out at one of the many [beaches](http://www.chicagotraveler.com/chicago-beaches.htm), roam the [neighborhoods](http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/Neighborhood-Guides/), or find something [cultural](http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/arts-and-culture/Section?oid=939136) to do ([or not](http://www.timeout.com/chicago)). If we weren't busy, we'd likely head to one of the many summer street festivals going on that weekend:

* [Bucktown Arts Fest](http://bucktownartsfest.com/history/)
* [Randolph Street Market ](http://www.randolphstreetmarket.com/randolphstreetmarket/)
* [Old Town Sausage Fest](http://www.sausagekingchicago.com/)
* [Chicago Fashion Fest](http://www.chicagofashionfest.com/)
* [Magnificent Mile Shopping Fest](http://www.themagnificentmile.com/events/shopping-festival/)

### <i class="fa fa-ambulance" />&nbsp;IS IT SAFE?

Yes. Yes it is.
