How to get here and get around, [where to stay](#hotels), and [what to do](#todo).

### <i class="fa fa-plane" />&nbsp;AIRPORTS

Fly into O'Hare (ORD) or Midway (MDW), whichever is cheaper or easier.

From O'Hare, you can get hotel shuttles, taxis, or take the "CTA Train to City", which is a Blue Line El train (recommended) to the Clark and Lake station.

From Midway, take the Orange Line CTA train to the Clark and Lake station.

From Clark and Lake, it's easy to get a taxi, or it's a short and safe walk to nearby hotels (see map below).

### <i class="fa fa-train" />&nbsp;CTA EL TRAINS

To get around via El trains (other than back and forth to the airport), the [CTA website](http://www.transitchicago.com/mobile/traintracker.aspx) is mobile friendly, or you can install the [Transit app](http://thetransitapp.com/). Unfortunately there's no train close to the venue, but cabs are everywhere downtown, as is Uber.

### <i class="fa fa-car" />&nbsp;RENTAL CARS

Don't do it! You don't need it and don't want it.

### <a name="hotels"></a><i class="fa fa-hotel" />&nbsp;HOTELS

We'll be staying at Hotel Lincoln, which is across the street from the venue, in order to get ready on the big day. If you want to overpay for a room, you're welcome to do the same! Otherwise, we'd suggest either of the next two, at Michigan and Wacker.

* [Hotel Lincoln](http://bit.ly/1xaTOnc), $350/night, across the street from venue, in [Lincoln Park](http://www.timeout.com/chicago/lincoln-park).

* <span style="color: #944;">TBD: in process of blocking off 10 rooms at the Red Roof Inn for ~$160/night</span>

* [Club Quarters](http://bit.ly/1xaUn0f), $160/night special right now. Located at Michigan &amp; Wacker in [Streeterville](http://www.thechicagoneighborhoods.com/Streeterville), next to Magnificent Mile and River North neighborhoods. Interesting places to walk around, shop, eat, explore. Right on the Chicago river!

* [River Hotel](http://bit.ly/1xaUucg), $160/night special right now. Same location as Club Quarters. And the same address. Same hotel???

* There's plenty of [airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/s/Chicago--IL--United-States?checkin=08%2F27%2F2015&checkout=08%2F30%2F2015&guests=2&room_types%5B%5D=Entire+home%2Fapt&price_max=200&sw_lat=41.88453510883599&sw_lng=-87.6510388633003&ne_lat=41.91206866445559&ne_lng=-87.62601921760938&zoom=15&search_by_map=true&ss_id=qcfcdu2g) properties near the venue, many of which are cheaper than area hotels. Parents of the groom found a nice one on Sedgwick.

* [Hilton at O'Hare Airport](http://bit.ly/1xaTy7B)
Only $110, but an hour from the venue and city, and nothing nearby to do or eat. If you're planning to come all the way to Chicago and see nothing but the venue (sad face!), you would still probably enjoy yourself more staying at one of the downtown hotels.

### <a name="todo"></a><i class="fa fa-thumbs-up" />&nbsp;THINGS TO DO

Chicago is a great place to be in the summertime! Check out a [bicycle](https://www.divvybikes.com/) from stations all over the city and explore the 18mi bike path on Lake Michigan, camp out at one of the many [beaches](http://www.chicagotraveler.com/chicago-beaches.htm), roam the [neighborhoods](http://www.timeout.com/chicago/neighborhoods), take an [architecture cruise](http://www.architecture.org/rivercruise) on the Chicago River, a [walking tour](http://www.insidechicagowalkingtours.com/#!tourcalendar/c127i), or find something [cultural](http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/arts-and-culture/Section?oid=939136) to do. If we weren't busy, we'd likely be at one of the many summer street festivals going on that weekend:

* [Old Town Sausage Fest](http://www.sausagekingchicago.com/) (live music, food, drink)
* [Bucktown Arts Fest](http://bucktownartsfest.com/history/) (live music, food, drink, lotsa artists booths)
* [Randolph Street Market](http://www.randolphstreetmarket.com/randolphstreetmarket/)
* [Chicago Fashion Fest](http://www.chicagofashionfest.com/)
* [Magnificent Mile Shopping Fest](http://www.themagnificentmile.com/events/shopping-festival/)
