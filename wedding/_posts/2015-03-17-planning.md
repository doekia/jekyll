Trying to plan a wedding in about half the recommended timeframe is chaotic.
So far <strike>we've been lucky to have found</strike> Amanda found the perfect venue, clothes to wear, rings to exchange, and a photographer. We're about to move forward with a caterer, and at last, Save the Dates!
The rest of our to-do's are in a massive
<a target="_blank" href="http://blog.trello.com/say-yes-to-less-stress-using-trello-to-plan-a-wedding/">Trello</a> project, which a coordinator is helping to tame.

This website is very much under construction, but the Travel page should answer some questions for out-of-towners. Please don't hesitate to contact us via the email in the footer. We'll continue adding posts to this News section as we finalize more plans.

Thanks for checking in, and hope to see you in August!
