Trying to plan a wedding in about half the recommended timeframe is chaotic!
So far we've been very lucky to have found the perfect venue, clothes to wear, rings to exchange, and a photographer. We're about to move forward with a caterer, and at last, Save the Dates!
The rest of our to-do's are in a massive
<a target="_blank" href="http://blog.trello.com/say-yes-to-less-stress-using-trello-to-plan-a-wedding/">Trello project</a>,
which we're hoping a planner/coordinator can help tame.

We'll post updates here as we finalize more plans, and continue adding info for our out-of-town guests. Thanks for checking in, and hope to see you in August!
