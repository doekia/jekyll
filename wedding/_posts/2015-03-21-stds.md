Save The Date cards, that is (made you look!) We realize we're sending these out late, but if you don't already have beach plans we're furiously scheming for a great party on August 29th!

Trying to plan a wedding in such a short timeframe has been chaotic.
So far we've been lucky to have found the perfect venue, tux and dress, rings to exchange, and photographer. We're about to move forward with a caterer (no bacon wrapped dates, promise!) As of today we have a wedding coordinator we're excited about, who will help tame our
<a target="_blank" href="http://blog.trello.com/say-yes-to-less-stress-using-trello-to-plan-a-wedding/">Trello</a> board.

We'll keep growing this website with pictures, stories and resources as we work out more details. For now the Travel page should be helpful for out-of-towners. Please don't hesitate to [email us](mailto:us@steveamandagetmarried.info) if you have any questions.

Thanks for checking in, and hope to see you in August!
