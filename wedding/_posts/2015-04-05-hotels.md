We were able to negotiate a reduced rate for a block of 10 rooms at the Red Roof Inn. I stayed there when I first came to Chicago for an interview in 1998. Small but nice, and a great location. A short cab ride to the venue (cabs everywhere in that area), lots of things to do, see and eat within easy walking distance. The location is now pinned to the map on the [travel](/travel/#hotels) page, along with contact info for the hotel.

We realize we're asking a lot having the wedding here in Chicago, but are hoping to make coming here super easy and worth it.
